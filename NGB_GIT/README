Engiebits (NGB) is a framework designed to handle the basic setup of a
video game, using 2D, 3D, or even 2.5D graphics.  NGB handles the drawing
of game objects, basic resource loading, 2D physics, 3D audio, handling
GLUT windows and simple event listeners.  NGB does not impose itself, and
can be easily overriden using calls to any of the libraries with which it
was developed.

NGB is developed in C using:
	Mesa 3D OpenGL
	GLEW
	FreeGLUT
	OpenAL
	ALUT
